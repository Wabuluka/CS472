fs.readFileSync(), - 
reads the entire file synchronous. It blocks the entire program execution till the entire process is done.
It is suitable for small files.

fs.readFile() - 
reads the entire file asynchronously. Uses the callback function to handle results. It is ideal for larger files

fs.promises.readFile() -
found in fs/promise, is promise based and uses fs.readFile() but with await. It reads the entire file asynchronously and returns the 
result as a promise.

fs.createReadStream() -
creates a readable stream for the file, this makes it possible to read the content in chunks. Its the best for reading extremely large files.
